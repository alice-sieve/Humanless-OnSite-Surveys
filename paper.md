# Summary

We are publishing an approach where on site surveys would be implemented with tiny
devices. For the publication we are show casing one device which can captureimages
in a onsite location and annonating the images and resulting in score which would
determine the survey result. We press on human less surveys for avoiding any discrepancies.
The devices which can walk and fly would is implemented for an environment. We
have implemented this with 90% success rate. We take human for a survey of hospitals
and let them observe the paint, floor, dogs inside where humans should be as examples.
We send the device which can walk avoiding human inhibitions and fly if necessary
and telly the rate. As further implementation we work on making the device smaller,
faster and cheaper. The paper also publishes the computer vision alogrithm research
done for implementing in small hardware devices for faster results.
